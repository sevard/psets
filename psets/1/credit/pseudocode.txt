Algorithm invented by Hans Peter Luhn of IBM

* Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with second-to-last digit.
* Add those products' digit together.
* Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren't multiplied by 2.
* If the total's last digit is 0, number is valid!

For the sake of discussion, let’s first underline every other digit, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit:
 4003600000000014

Okay, let’s multiply each of the underlined digits by 2:
 1•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 0•2 + 6•2 + 0•2 + 4•2

That gives us:
 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 12 + 0 + 8

Now let’s add those products’ digits (i.e., not the products themselves) together:
  2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 13

Now let’s add that sum (13) to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2 (starting from the end):
 13 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 20

Yup, the last digit in that sum (20) is a 0, so David’s card is legit!

American Express numbers start with 34, 37
MasterCard numbers start with 51, 52, 53, 54, 55
Visa numbers start with 4
